•	Context: 
Overweight and obesity are emerging health problems in India not only in cities but now increasing rapidly in rural areas as well. 
Overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases. 
Obesity can increase the risk of developing many health conditions like Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension (High blood pressure), Coronary heart disease and stroke, Asthma, liver and kidney diseases any many other comorbidities.
In Assessment of obesity Height and weight: are the simplest and commonly used measures. Overweight and obesity can be diagnosed by calculating body mass index (BMI) of an individual. I have developed AI based Model to predict possible disease a person can suffer in near future and suggests its preventions also.
This would help people to live healthy lives and create awareness to avoid comorbid complications among population of urban as well as rural areas.

•	How does it work: 
Health advisor model has been trained to calculate BMI based on individual’s weight and height and it is trained to predict disease and associated comorbidities in obesity and overweight cases accordingly it gives recommendations to prevent complications
Model makes use of python – 3.8 for friendly interface and visual studio code, several libraries like KnearestNeighbor, pandas, scikit learn and many others.
Currently the model has database of around 4000 disease and 17 symptoms of each associated to respective diseases obtained from Kaggle, I am planning to add around 50 more diseases based on prevalence in India, Asia and world so that it can be used by anyone in the world. 

•	Summary: 
A personalized AI based health advisor which suggest & predict probable disease one can suffer in near future based on today’s health conditions and BMI. 
It can be used by common people, health care centers and hospitals to create awareness & assessment of patients in IPD & OPD.Health advisor would be able to identify the disease and would suggest precautions to be taken in these diseases state.
Which can be prevent by setting realistic goals for Management and prevention of Overweight & obesity by changing in lifestyle, eating habits, and regular physical activity.
